\chapter*{Notation}

The following mathematical symbols are used throughout the thesis. 

Scalars (integer or real), vectors, and matrices are denoted using italics, for example:

$$
a, \vec{a}, \vec{A}
$$

for scalar, vector and matrix respectively. An element of a vector $\vec{a}$ is denoted as

$$
a_i
$$

and an element of a matrix $\vec{A}$ is denoted as 

$$
a_{i,j}.
$$

Random variables are denote using uppercase regular font, for example:

$$
A
$$ 

and they always represent a scalar random variable.
