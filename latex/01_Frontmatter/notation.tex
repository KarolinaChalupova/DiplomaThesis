\chapter*{Notation}

The terms \textbf{characteristics}, \textbf{predictors} and \textbf{features} are used interchangeably and refer to the firm-specific variables based on which the returns are predicted (inputs to the neural network). The term \textit{characteristics} is used in asset-pricing literature, the term \textit{predictors} in econometrics, and \textit{features} in machine learning. 

The following mathematical symbols are used throughout the thesis. 

Scalars, vectors, and matrices are denoted using italics, for example:

$$
a, \vec{a}, \vec{A}
$$

for scalar, vector and matrix respectively. An element of a vector $\vec{a}$ is denoted as

$$
a_i
$$

and an element of a matrix $\vec{A}$ is denoted as 

$$
a_{i,j}.
$$

Random variables are denoted using uppercase italics, for example:

$$
A
$$ 

and they always represent a scalar random variable.
