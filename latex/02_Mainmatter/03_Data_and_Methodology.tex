\section{Data}

	I obtain the dataset from \cite{tobek2020does}. The dataset comprises of liquid publicly traded shares from developed countries of Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore). The data is monthly and spans from 1990 to 2018. I use the liquid universe, which contains 8,350 companies,  totaling 1,607,117 observations. 
	
	This thesis uses 30 anomalies that were identified as strongest predictors of equity returns in the \cite{tobek2020does} paper. The authors compute 153  anomalies, firm-level characteristics that have been put forward by leading financial and accounting journals as predictors of equity returns. The authors then use the 153 anomalies in a single model, which allows individual effects to crowd each other out, and results in ordering of the predictors from the strongest to the weakest. This thesis takes 30 predictors identified as strongest on liquid global universe of stocks (Figure 8 in \cite{tobek2020does}).
	
	Table [TODO add summary table] shows the 30 anomalies studied. 
	
	I preprocess all predictors in the following manner (in line with \cite{gu2020empirical}). First, I winsorize bottom and top 1\% of each variable to mitigate the impact of observations with implausibly large or small values. Second, I center each variable so that its mean is 0 and subsequently normalize so that the resulting values lie between -1 and 1. This is done because neural networks work better with data on the same scale. Finally, I impute missing values by mean (that is, 0), as all values entering a neural network must be numerical and the value 0 can be interpreted as "no information". I perform all these operations on data grouped by year, that is, first split the data into groups by year, then apply the transformations and finally combine back into single dataset. The main motivation for this is to prevent information from getting from test sets to training and validation sets.    	
	
	Table \ref{tab:descr} shows descriptive statistics of the anomalies data after these transformations.
		
	Figure \ref{fig:corrplot}, shows plot of the correlation matrix of the anomalies.

	The task is to predict the return of given stock in month $t+1$ given that stock's anomalies as of the time $t$. (Two technical notes: first, the dataset is organized so that this shift is taken care of, i.e., the features corresponding to the given target have the same index. Second, the anomalies as of the time $t-1$ can be (and often are) calculated from raw data based on several preceding time periods, e.g., $t$, $t-1$, $t-2$ and therefore the time index  represents the entire information set rather than financial or accounting information being \textit{published} at that time index. For example, a single observation at a given time index $t$ consists of the target (stock's return in $t+1$), and anomalies calculated as of $t$, such as average return in the last six months ($t$, $t-1$, $t-2$, $t-3$, $t-4$, $t-5$))

\section{Methodology}

	I train 5 distinct feed-forward neural networks, each with 9 different random seeds. The architecture and training follows closely \cite{gu2020empirical}, which represents very standard neural networks used in the task of equity return prediction from anomaly data. I compare the performance to that reached in the very same paper. Next, I interpret the neural networks using feature importance and investigate whether this interpretability is robust across different random seeds. I also investigate whether the interpretation of the model is stable in time. This  section describes the methodological issues related, in this order, to the model's architecture, training, performance evaluation and interpretation of the neural networks employed in this thesis.
	
	\subsection{Architecture of the Neural Networks}
	
	The prediction task is to predict stock's return in the following month using a set of the stock's charasteristics calculated as of the current month. My neural networks' architecture is a standard one for this prediction task and identical to \cite{gu2020empirical}. In summary: all networks are feed-forward with the input dimension 30 and the output dimension 1; models of 5 different depths are used, with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hidden layers consisting of 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 neurons each respectively; all layers are fully connected, with batch-normalization \citep{ioffe2015batch} and ReLU activations on all hidden layers. As this is a regression problem, there is no activation on the output layer. The weights are regularized using l1 penalty. The following explains and motivates these choices in detail, but a reader who is already well-versed in neural network design can easily skip to the next subsection, concerned with training. 
	
	First, let us describe a feed-forward neural network in general terms (e.g., \cite{goodfellow2016deep}). A feed-forward neural network can be represented as directed graph, consisting of several layers. The input layer of $N$ neurons (nodes in the graph). This layer is connected to the next layer of neurons (the first hidden layer) by edges going from each input neuron to each hidden layer neuron. When each neuron of a layer is connected to each neuron in the next layer, we say that the two layers are fully connected. Each edge connecting two neurons is parametrized by a single trainable weight. More hidden layers can be connected to the previous hidden layer in the same fashion. Finally, the last hidden layer is connected, again, fully, to the output layer, which is the final prediction.
	
	This directed graph is a representation of the computation performed by the neural network to get from the input to the output. The values of a given hidden layer, \vec{h}, are computed using the previous layer's values $\vec{x}$, and the matrix of weights on the edges $\vec{W}$ using sum of products: 
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{h} = f(\vec{W}\vec{x})
	\end{equation}
	
	or written element-wise, the value of neuron $h_i$ in the hidden layer is computed as 
	
	\begin{equation}
		h_i = f \left( \sum_{j}w_{i,j}x_j \right)
	\end{equation}
	
	where the function $f$ is a non-linear activation function, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU):
	
	\[
		f(z) = \text{ReLU}(z) =   
			\begin{cases}
				1 & \text{if } z \geq 0\\
				0 & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases}.
	\]
	
	The output layer is computed using the last hidden layer in the same manner, except in the case of regression there is no activation function. Denoting $\vec{V}$ the weights on the last edges and $\vec{h}$ the output of the last hidden layer, the output of the neural network $\vec{o}$ has the elements: 
	
	\begin{equation}
		o_i = \sum_{j}v_{i,j} h_j.
	\end{equation}
	
	In this thesis, the output is a scalar, so this further simplifies to 
	
	\begin{equation}
		o = \sum_{j}v_{j} h_j.
	\end{equation}
	
	Obviously, in the case of neural network without hidden layers, the model simplifies to linear regression. Adding a hidden layer, which is a non-linear interaction of the previous layer's neurons, the input features are allowed to interact in any manner. Essentially, a hidden layer represents the input features in a sparser manner, generating more abstract, all-encompassing information from them. This information then enters the next hidden layer and the information is made yet more high-level. This continues until the output layer, which produces the most high-level information: the prediction. In this way, the network learns to find relationships between the features such that they predict the target (here, the return) well. The network's depth corresponds to the complexity of the model: the model with a single hidden layer can be considered the least complex one, as the inputs only enter one non-linear interaction, and the complexity increases up to 5 hidden layers, where the most abstract or high-level information is extracted. 
	
	In this thesis, a neural network takes input of 30 real numbers (the stock's characteristics at given time point, dimension of the input layer) and propagates it through the series of hidden layers to produce the return prediction.	A choice must be made as to the number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer. While on optimal architecture can be searched for, here it is not necessary, as reaching the best possible performance is not the goal of this thesis. Instead, I follow \cite{gu2020empirical} and use the same numbers of layers and neurons: I train models of 5 different depths (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hidden layers), with 32 neurons in the first layer, 16 in the second layer, 8 in the third, 4 in the fourth and 2 in the fifth.  
	
	In addition, I add a batch-normalization layer \citep{ioffe2015batch} after every hidden layer. This changes the above formula for hidden layer values to: 
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{h} = \text{ReLU}(\text{BN}(\vec{W}\vec{x}))
	\end{equation}
	
	where $\text{BN}$ represents the batch-normalization operation. The operation simply normalizes its input data (subtracts sample mean and divides by sample variance). The data is split to batches to improve computing speed of the operation. The operation helps with multiple aspects of training the neural networks, as it prevents the values coming out of a hidden layer from being extreme. This helps to regularize the network and also speeds up the training. Importantly, it helps with the problem of "internal covariate shift", where the distributions of inputs to hidden layers are shifted relative to their validation and testing counterparts, which harms the predictive power and the convergence. By demeaning and standardizing the data, batch normalization preserves the information contained in the hidden layer while preventing the covariate shift \citep{ioffe2015batch}. 
	
	
	\subsection{Training, Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning}
	
	Training of the network is an optimization problem where we are looking parameters (model's weights on the edges) such that the model predicts the target well. As this problem does not have a close-form solution, it must be solved numerically. This is done in the following manner. At the beginning of training, the model is initialized with small random weights, where the random state is determined using the selected random seed. Prediction is computed using these weights, and the weights are then adjusted using the gradient of a loss, where the loss measures how good the prediction is. Descending the loss function in this manner is called gradient descent. As my problem is a regression, I use mean squared error as a loss. This is applied iteratively until a stopping criterion is met and the final weights are extracted. 
	
	The data is fed to the network in so-called batches, meaning that several inputs are processed together and the gradient is calculated after each batch (stochastic gradient descent). When all training data was exactly once fed to the neural network, we say one epoch has passed. This is repeated for a number of epochs. I use batch size of 5,000, which is enough for processing the data reasonably fast while not overflowing the memory. I use 100 epochs in line with \cite{gu2020empirical}, but this number is never actually reached during the training (it works just as an upper limit), due to early stopping, as explained below.
	
	There are several optimizers one can use to descend the slopes of the loss function. In line with \cite{gu2020empirical}, I use Adam optimizer. The advantage of Adam is two-fold. First, it essentially lowers the learning rate as the training progresses. The learning rate governs the size of the step that the optimizer takes in the direction of negative gradient in the gradient descent. Shrinking the learning rate gradually allows faster learning at the beginning of the training and a more nuanced convergence near the optimum [TODO add citation]. [TODO refresh the theory behind using Adam and desribe the advantages better]. (In about 1\% of the cases, the optimized model learns to predict just the average of the training data. I retrain these models using SGD optimizer instead.)
	
	Neural networks are non-parametric way of modeling the relationship between the predictors and the predicted variables, in the sense that there is no apriori assumption made about the functional form of the relationship. In fact, the Universal Approximation Theorem shows that with already a single hidden layer, the network outlined above is able to approximate any "well-behaved" function arbitrarily well. This is directly opposed to the linear approach, where we fit the relationship between inputs and outputs assuming a linear functional form. 
	
	This necessarily means that neural networks are prone to overfitting the training data. An overfitted model performs well on the training data and poorly on previously unseen data. This is a problem, as the point of having a model in the first place is to be able to draw general conclusions and predict from new data. This is why the models are evaluated solely on held-out data (testing sample), which is disjoint from both training and validation sample, both for purposes of measuring performance and interpreting the models. In addition, there is a number of methods that can be used to prevent overfitting on the training data in the first place, commonly called regularization. The goal is to limit the training process to prevent overfitting while leaving enough room for learning. I use the same regularization techniques as \cite{gu2020empirical}, namely, learning rate shrinkage, batch normalization, early stopping, weight regularization, and ensembling. I have already discussed the use of batch normalization and learning rate shrinkage. I now describe how I use the remaining methods. 
	
	Early stopping amounts to ceasing the training at some earlier point than reaching the pre-specified number of epochs. To determine that point, one can evaluate the model's predictive power after each epoch. A subsample of the data disjoint from training data (called validation sample) is used for the evaluation. This simulates the out-of-sample performance. When the validation loss increases for $k$ consecutive epochs ($k$ is called patience), training is stopped. In line with \cite{gu2020empirical}, I use patience of 5. 
	
	Weight regularization allows to punish the model for finding too big weights, as large weights are a symptom of overfitting. The size of weights can be measured as their L2 or L1 norm, L1 norm is used here. The strength of the weight regularization is chosen as a hyperparameter on validation data and line with \cite{gu2020empirical}, as described below in the section on hyperparameter tuning.
	
	Ensembling, averaging the predictions of multiple models, is widely discussed in the Literature Review. It can be considered a regularization technique, as different models can overfit to training data differently, their average takes out this error and thus is able to generalize better. I construct the ensembles in a common way and in line with \cite{gu2020empirical}, by averaging the same model across its different random seeds. I use 9 random seeds for each model (that is, for each train-validation-test split and each architecture). As models with different random seed can be trained in parallel, this does not place a burden on the computation time.
		
	The remaining modelling choices (starting learning rate and strength of l1 regularization) are done using hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameters discussed so far are not very data-specific, so it suffices to choose them using prior literature: I use \cite{gu2020empirical}, as we share the exact same prediction task. However, there are parameters that are very data-specific, and must therefore be chosen using the data. Choosing the parameters on the training data would lead to overfitting, which is why they are selected using a sample disjoint from training data, called validation sample. This is called hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, I tune the learning rate and the strength of l1 regularization. Each model (each of its 9 random seeds) is run 20 independent times, each time sampling the learning rate and the l1 hyperparameters randomly from pre-specified intervals using logarithmic distribution. The intervals are $\left[1\mathrm{e}{-3}, 1\mathrm{e}{-2}\right]$ and $\left[1\mathrm{e}{-5}, 1\mathrm{e}{-3}\right]$ respectively, again in line with \cite{gu2020empirical}. A single best instance is then selected, as determined by predictive performance of the model on the validation set.
